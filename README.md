# Overview

Cumulative cultural evolution relies on a sufficiently [high transmission fidelity
of traits](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rstb.2012.0119). Humans 
are good at imitating and teaching, which allowed rapid technological advances within
an evolutionarily short time frame.

What can we learn from this about artificial general intelligence (AGI) systems
of the future? Using simulations similar to those used in cultural evolution, 
this project explores the role of reasoning and judgement for recursively improving
AIs.
